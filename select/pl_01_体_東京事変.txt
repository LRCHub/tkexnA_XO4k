I've got the time
for more than talking
The sound of your voice
is drawing me in
You say you got
my groove I turn you on
Show me it's true
till the day is gone
There's stram tonight
The heat is right
Shall we check it out
Come closer dear
It's warmer in here
But you know that well
I'll do anything to help you on
To hear you cry out a song
I've got the time
for more than talking
My hands want to glide
across your body
You put me in the mood
let's work this groove
I feel my skin
melting away on you
<♪>
You'll do everything
to help me on
To hear me cry out so long
I've got the time
for more than talking
My tongue wants a taste
of what you're fixing me
If you send me up
high I won't come down
My heat is rising
I want all of you now
<♪>
I've got the time
for more that talking
