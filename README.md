[00:01.87] I've got the time for more than talking
[00:08.75] The sound of your voice is drawing me in
[00:16.26] You say you got my groove I turn you on
[00:23.70] Show me it's true till the day is gone
[00:42.70] 
[00:31.37] There's steam tonight
[00:34.63] The heat is right
[00:38.20] Shall we check it ou
[00:48.20] 
[00:45.77] Come closer dear
[00:49.05] It's warmer in here
[00:52.62] But you know that well
[01:03.62] 
[01:01.10] I'll do anything to help you on
[01:16.60] 
[01:14.65] To hear you cry out a song
[01:27.65] 
[01:21.91] I've got the time for more than talking
[01:28.57] My hands want to glide across your body
[01:36.41] You put me in the mood let's work this groove
[01:43.66] I feel my skin melting away on you
[02:00.66] 
[02:21.48] You'll do everything to help me on
[02:34.49] To hear me cry out so long
[02:47.49] 
[02:45.17] I've got the time for more than talking
[02:52.20] My tongue wants a taste of what you're fixing me
[03:00.33] If you send me up high I won't come down
[03:07.11] My heat is rising I want all of you now
[03:26.61] 
[03:43.21] I've got the time for more than talking
